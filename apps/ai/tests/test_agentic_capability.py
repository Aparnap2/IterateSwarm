"""Capability-Based Agentic AI Tests — OntologyAI V6.

These tests prove the system can ACTUALLY REASON using a live LLM (Groq).
They validate **capabilities** (what the system CAN DO) rather than
**scenarios** (specific business situations), so they survive ontology
pack changes, prompt rewrites, and model swaps.

CAPABILITY CONTRACTS:
  1. Evidence Runtime — extract, structure, validate raw signals
  2. Knowledge Runtime — map evidence to ontology objects
  3. Decision Context — retrieve, rerank, compress context
  4. Decision Runtime — generate options, tradeoffs, recommendations
  5. Hallucination Resistance — no invention without evidence
  6. Contradiction Detection — conflicting sources flagged
  7. Partial Context — uncertainty expressed when evidence is thin

NO MOCKS. NO STUBS. REAL LLM. REAL REASONING.
